# KinetiScan

KinetiScan is an application that helps users analyze their joint movements, like shoulder motions, for recovery after injury. 
By using a camera, the app tracks your range of motion in real-time and provides a score based on how well your movements align with healthy ranges. 
It also offers progress tracking, visual reports, and personalized recommendations to improve recovery. 
The app is designed for athletes, physical therapy patients, or anyone looking to monitor and enhance their movement recovery.
